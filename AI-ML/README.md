# AI/ML

AI/ML—short for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)—represents an important evolution in computer science and data processing that is quickly transforming a vast array of industries.Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.

# Task: Perform EDA on any one of the given dataset
## Overview
Given are two datasets, `IPL_BAll_BY_BALL.csv` and `IPL_MATCHES.csv` containing each match summary and each match ball by ball details respectively. You are required to perform general Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the datasets.

## Requirements
* The kernel(or notebook) must be in the form of `.ipynb` format
* Use of [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is preferred
* There should be atleast one analysis for each feature of the dataset

## Evaluation
The notebook evaluation will be based on:
* How well the notebook is documented. 
* How well the data are analyzed using different graphs
* Explaination for each graph or set of graphs
* The more the analysis performed, the better

# Deadline
You will have 10 days to complete this task. Please submit your completed work by 11th April 11:59 PM IST.

# Submission 
After completion of your task add a text file in [Task submission]() folder with your project's repo link
