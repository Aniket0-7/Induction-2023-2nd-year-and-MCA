# Game Development
Game Development is the art of creating games and describes the design, development and release of a game. It may involve concept generation, design, build, test and release. While you create a game, it is important to think about the game mechanics, rewards, player engagement and level design.

# Task: Create a 3D game. Details are mentioned below.

## Overview

You'll create a 3D game. An arena, a participant (a cube), and a few objects (spheres) of various colours will all be present. Any collectible that the player touches is destroyed, and the score is updated appropriately. The game concludes when all items have been collected.

## Requirements

- The player should be able to move freely in the arena (asdw).
- The camera should follow the player.
- Only when the player touches the spheres are they required to be destroyed.
- You are free to add any additional features you like to make the website more interesting and engaging.

## Deliverables

- Export the game in webGL or windows or mac.
- Upload Zip file of the project.
- A readme file that includes instructions on how the game works and any additional information you think is relevant.
- Host your game on [itch.io](https://itch.io/) .

## Evaluation

Your work will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- The game must be fully functional and meet the requirements outlined above.
- The code must be well-written, with clear and concise comments where necessary.
- The game should be visually appealing and easy to navigate.
- Additional features will be evaluated based on their usefulness and creativity.

## Deadline

You will have 10 days to complete this task. Please submit your completed work by 11th April 11:59 PM.

## Submission

After completion of your task add a text file in [Task submission](https://github.com/EnigmaVSSUT/Induction-2023-2nd-year-and-MCA/tree/main/Web%20development/Task%20Submission) folder with your repo and hosted website link.
