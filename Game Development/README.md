# Game Development

Game Development is the art of creating games and describes the design, development and release of a game. It may involve concept generation, design, build, test and release. While you create a game, it is important to think about the game mechanics, rewards, player engagement and level design.

# Task: Create a 3D game. Details are mentioned below.

## Overview

You'll create a 3D game. An arena, a participant (a cube), and a few objects (spheres) of various colours will all be present. Any collectible that the player touches is destroyed, and the score is updated appropriately. The game concludes when all items have been collected. You can check the given image for reference.
