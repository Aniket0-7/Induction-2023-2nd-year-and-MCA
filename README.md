We welcome all the 2nd years and MCA candidates to Induction 2023 and we hope that you all are excited and ready to showcase your skills, and eventually get inducted into the club.



Here at Enigma, we have always given more emphasis on knowledge transfer and that is how we would start your Enigma journey too 😎

Enigma inductions are not primarily exams. They consist of 3 stages:

1. **Knowledge Transfer** 🔃
> We will be having Knowledge Transfer workshops on Open Source, Web Development, AI/ML and Competitive Programming according to the schedule that will be provided to you.


2. **Assessment** 🏹
> You would have to submit tasks provided after workshops in the respective domains which will be assessed.


3. **Personal Interview** 👨‍⚖️
> Selected candidates from the previous two stages will advance to the next stage, i.e., a Personal Interview.


__N.B.: All the tasks will have their own deadlines__

## Schedule

Let's brief the 10 days long venture. It is a well planned path for you all to test your skills. The whole process is to be continued for 10 days starting from 2nd April 2023.

## Task Details:
There are various options in domains. You can **`choose your domain`** and work out the task for that provided in the repective folders. You can choose multiple domains if you want but the time would be same for all and no extra time will be given for anyone. <br>

## How to get started?
1. Head over to **`https://github.com/EnigmaVSSUT/Induction-2023-2nd-year-and-MCA`** and click on the fork button. This creates a copy of this repository in your repositories so you can start working on the project without directly making changes in the owner's code.

Now, go to your profile and you should see Induction-2023-2nd-year-and-MCA repository under your repositories. This is your forked repo.

2. Now that you have your own copy of the repository it's time to make a copy of it on your local system so you can start contributing to the project. <br>

3. Now go to your forked repository, click on code and copy the repo address. This will be used to clone the repository to your local system.<br><br>
4. Go to the folder you'd like to make the copy of the repository and open git bash.<br>
This can be done by right clicking inside the folder and selecting the **`"Git Bash here"`** option. You must have git installed in order for this command to show up in the menu.<br><br>
5. Type the command <code>git clone <i>copied_repo_address</i></code><br><br>
6. Open the desired folder and start contributing.
